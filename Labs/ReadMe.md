# Labs: Learning R for Epidemiological Data Analysis

This directory contains various scripts and datasets used for building foundational R skills in data analysis, particularly in the context of epidemiology. The focus is on progressively learning techniques such as data visualization, statistical summaries, dataset adjustments, and regression analysis.

## Directory Structure

- **data/**  
  Contains multiple datasets used for exercises and practice.  
  **Note**: The **CCHS dataset (2015-2016 Canadian Community Health Survey)** is not included due to its size and GitHub restrictions. You can download it separately if needed.

- **scripts/**  
  Includes several R scripts demonstrating key R concepts and methods:
  - Basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, min, max, etc.)
  - Data visualization techniques
  - Adjusting datasets by weights
  - Logical regression
  - Calculating and interpreting adjusted and unadjusted Odds Ratios (ORs)

- **Labs.Rproj**  
  The R Project file, organizing the working environment for the lab activities.


## Objectives

The labs aim to provide hands-on experience in R programming, with exercises tailored to epidemiological data analysis. Key skills developed include:

- **Data Summarization**: Generating statistical summaries to understand datasets.
- **Visualization**: Creating meaningful plots and graphs to explore trends and relationships.
- **Data Transformation**: Adjusting datasets based on specific criteria (e.g., weighting).
- **Regression Analysis**: Applying and interpreting both logical regression models and Odds Ratios (adjusted and unadjusted).

# R-Epidemiological-Data-Analysis

This repository contains projects focused on R programming for data analysis, with an emphasis on epidemiological datasets. Each project folder showcases different aspects of R skills, progressing from foundational knowledge to application in analyzing datasets.
Each directory includes more detailed documentation about the specific tasks and learning objectives and is premade as an R project.

## Repository Structure

### 1. **Labs**
   - This folder documents the progression of learning R for data analysis.
   - Contains concepts and examples to build proficiency in R programming.

### 2. **Assignment 2**
   - Analyzes a provided COVID-19 dataset using R.
   - Focuses on generating generic statistics and gaining insights from the data.
   - Demonstrates intermediate R data manipulation and visualization techniques.

### 3. **Final Assignment**
   - Combines all the R skills learned throughout the course to analyze a dataset of choice.
   - Investigates a specific topic, providing a comprehensive analysis and insights.
   - Encourages creativity and application of advanced R techniques.

### Missing Data Files
   - Some datasets required for these projects are not included in the repository. Specifically, the **CCHS dataset (2015-2016 Canadian Community Health Survey)** is missing and needs to be downloaded separately due to file size and Git Hub restrictions.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you will need:
- **R**: The base R programming language installed on your system.
- **RStudio**: Recommended for an integrated development environment.
